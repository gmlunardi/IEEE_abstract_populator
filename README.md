# IEEE_abstract_populator

This script copies all values of the abstract field of a CSV file (only format available for download in IEEE Library) to a bibtex file. 

Before using this script you must do:

1. Open the original CSV and copy all the values of the DOI column;
2. Paste them into Zotero to create the bibtex;
3. Use the resulting bibtex as input to the script with the CSV file.
